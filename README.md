## Acknowledgments

This report template has been generated based on the guidelines provided in the [2022 Population PK guidance from the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/population-pharmacokinetics). The guidance is aimed to assist sponsors and applicants of new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and investigational new drugs (IND) applications in the application of population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, which is crucial for guiding drug development and informing recommendations on therapeutic individualization. Adherence to these guidelines ensures a well-structured and comprehensive presentation of the population PK analyses, facilitating a clear understanding for regulatory review and potentially alleviating the need for postmarketing requirements or commitments.
